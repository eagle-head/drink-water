# Drink Water App README

Drink Water is a mobile application designed to help users stay hydrated by reminding them to drink water throughout the day. The app allows users to create custom alarms that will remind them to drink water at specific intervals.

## Features

### Custom Alarms

Users can create custom alarms to remind them to drink water at specific intervals throughout the day. The app allows users to set the time for the alarm and choose the days of the week they want the alarm to be active. Users can also customize the sound of the alarm.

### Time-Restricted Alarms

Users can set the alarms to only ring within a certain time range. For example, a user can set an alarm to only ring between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM, which is useful for those who don't want to be disturbed during their sleep hours.

### Progress Tracking

The app allows users to track their water intake progress by logging the amount of water they drink throughout the day. The app provides a daily, weekly, and monthly summary of the user's water intake.

### Personalized Settings

Users can personalize the app settings to fit their individual needs. The app allows users to customize the volume of the alarm, choose their preferred measurement units for water intake (e.g., ounces or liters), and set reminders for specific times during the day.
